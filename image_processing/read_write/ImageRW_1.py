#Use the function cv2.imread() to read an image. The image should be in the working directory or a full path of image should be given.
#Second argument is a flag which specifies the way image should be read.
#cv2.IMREAD_COLOR : Loads a color image. Any transparency of image will be neglected. It is the default flag.
#cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE : Loads image in grayscale mode
#cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED : Loads image as such including alpha channel
#Note
#Instead of these three flags, you can simply pass integers 1, 0 or -1 respectively.

# Load an color image in grayscale

#img = cv2.imread('jap128.jpg',0)
img = cv2.imread('cromatisity.jpg',cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)
print 'Just read a picture'

#Even if the image path is wrong, it wonâ€™t throw any error, but print img will give you None
#Display an image
#Use the function cv2.imshow() to display an image in a window. The window automatically fits to the image size.
#First argument is a window name which is a string. second argument is our image. You can create as many windows as you wish, but with different window names.

cv2.imshow('image',img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

#Use the function cv2.imwrite() to save an image.

#First argument is the file name, second argument is the image you want to save.

cv2.imwrite('cromaticity.png',img)
#This will save the image in PNG format in the working directory.
